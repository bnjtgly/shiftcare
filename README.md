## Instruction
### Run the following command to test the code.
```bash
$ ruby test_search.rb
```
### Run the following command to run the application.
```bash
$ ruby main.rb
```
### Note:
- Ruby must me installed.
### Assumption: 
- For this challenge I assumed that the JSON file is in the same directory as the application, we can change the directory to a specific path if in real world examples. 
- I simplified the structure for this challenge only, we can use different design patterns and use background jobs if used in a real application. 
- Search class can also be use if we want to add API endpoints, so that we can have 1 source of truth within the simple upload/attach of file or through payload.
