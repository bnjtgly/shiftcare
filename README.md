### Note:
#### - For this challenge I assumed that the JSON file is in the same directory as the application, we can change the directory to a specific path if in real world examples. 
#### - I simplified the structure for this challenge only, we can use different design patterns and use background jobs if used in a real application. 
#### - Search class can also be use if we want to add API endpoints, so that we can have 1 source of truth within the simple upload/attach of file or through payload.
